# Loans_api

### Use case
A Lenme borrower would like to borrow $5,000.00 on paying them back in 6 months. One of the Lenme investors has offered him a 15% Annual Interest Rate. A $3.00 Lenme fee will be added to the total loan amount to be paid by the investor.  

### Requirements
You are required to develop a Django REST project to be able to build the following flow through its
APIs.
 
1. The borrower creates a loan request including the above loan amount and loan period 
2. The investor will submit an offer for the borrowerâ€™s loan request with the above interest rate
3. The borrower will accept the offer
4. Check if the investor has sufficient balance in their account before they fund the loan
5. The loan will be funded successfully and the loan status will be Funded
6. The loan payments will be created with the monthly amount to be paid and its due date
7. Once all the payments are successfully paid to the investor, the loan status will be Completed

### API Base URL
You can use the base server URL `localhost:[port]` to explore the API root and to get links for users and available loans.

### Authendication and Permissions
* Annonymous users can't perform transactions on the API.
* There are two types of custome users [Borrower, Investor] and both inherit from a User model Abstract class.
```
class User(AbstractUser):
    is_borrower = models.BooleanField(default=True)
    is_investor = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    balance = models.FloatField(default=0.0)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.username
```
* Only borrower user have GET and POST permissions for creating or browsing existing loans. Investors and anonymous users can read only.
* Only loan borrower has DELETE and PUT for his/her created loans.
* Only Investor can bid an invest.

You can use the following links for GET,POST, DELETE, and POST methods according to authendication and permission policies.
```
path('loans', loan_list, name='loan-list'),
path('loans/<id>', loan_detail, name='loan_detail'),
```
```
path('loans/<id>/invest', LoanRetrieveUpdateDestroy.as_view()),
path('invest/new', InvestCreate.as_view()),
```
```
path('users',user_list, name = 'user-list'),
path('users/<id>', user_detail, name='user-detail'),
```
```
path('api-auth/', include('rest_framework.urls')),
```
